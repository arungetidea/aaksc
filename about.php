            <p>Dear Friends,</p>
            <p>
              Teachers are builders of the nation. They are the real masons who
              lay the foundation of nation committed to the growth and
              development of values. The success of the student depends
              essentially upon the competence of teachers, their sense of
              dedication and their identification of the interests of students.
              A society cannot progress without the help of good teachers.<span id="dots" class="d-none">...</span>

            <span id="more">
            <p>
              AAKSC is established in order to share my learning and experience
              with you. I have a firm believe that God has never given dreams
              without ability to achieve them. These dreams can be achieved only
              by the dedicated mentors & hard-work of dreamer.
            </p>
            <p>
              A subject can be simplified, if a learner gets proper guidance to
              see it from different angles. I had proven in my teaching career
              (since 1996) that it can be simplified by systematic and friendly
              approach. Learning anything require positive attitude and strong
              desire to attain perfection in it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In these crucial years, students & their families go through a
              tough time, they need a place where they can found a friend who
              can dilute their worries & has empathy with them. Our testimonials
              indicates that we always try to be the one.
            </p>
            <p>
              AAKSC is a platform for students to explore their potentials. We
              not only take care of academic aspects but also emphasize on
              social and environmental issues through SAMCHETNA and AAKSC
              PARIVAR.
            </p>
            <p>So lets simplify chemistry with joint efforts.</p>
            <p>Make learning as simple as drinking water.</p>
